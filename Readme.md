# CV Website Project — Adrián Cano Cabello



### User Profile
The main target user of my CV website is a **junior recruiter or HR professional** in the technology sector who is searching for entry-level developers or computer engineering students for internships or junior positions.   
A secondary user could be a **professor or university staff member** who wants to check my personal portfolio for academic or research-related purposes.  
Recruiters usually work from desktop devices, but the website also adapts well to mobile screens to ensure accessibility.

### Information Architecture
The CV website is designed as a **single-page layout** divided into six clear sections that can be accessed through vertical scrolling or navigation links. The sections are structured as follows:  

1. **About:** Contains my name, title, location, and quick contact links (GitHub, LinkedIn, email). It immediately introduces who I am and what I do.  
2. **Projects:** Highlights two projects that demonstrate my technical skills. One is a real project linked to my GitHub, and the second is a demo project designed to show my web development abilities. Each project is presented as a card with a title, description, and link.  
3. **Skills:** Lists my programming and design abilities. I divided them into *Design* and *Development*.  
4. **Experience:** Describes relevant experience or mock professional examples related to my field, showing roles, dates, and company names. Logos are included to make it more visual.  
5. **Education:** Presents my academic background.
6. **Contact:** Provides a clear way to reach me by email or LinkedIn, and ends with a footer section.  

This order ensures that the visitor first sees my identity and evidence of skills before reading contextual background information.

### Visual Design
The visual design is minimalist and modern, using a light palette with blue accents (#4f7cff) to convey clarity and professionalism.
The layout features a two-column structure with a fixed sidebar and main content area for easy navigation.
Typography uses Inter for readability, and soft shadows with rounded cards add depth.
Overall, the design reflects a clean, young, and tech-oriented identity consistent with my Computer Engineering background.
